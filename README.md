Spell words using the NATO phonetic alphabet.

If you find yourself in an English speaking country, but you are not a
native speaker, you can get in the embarrassing situation where you
have to spell something over the phone (usually your name or an
address) but you still cannot make the other person understand it
correctly.

The [NATO phonetic
alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) comes
to rescue offering a list of well known code words, one for each
letter in the Latin alphabet.

Sadly I never managed to learn it. So I decided to write an app for
it.

This project is available as a [Progressive Web
App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
at the address https://lorentz83.github.io/AlfaZulu/

Meaning that, while it is a website and therefore it is perfectly
usable by any browser, you can use it also offline and it integrates
well with mobile phones!

Instruction about how to install it varies a little depending on the
browser that you use. But, generally speaking, look for an `Install`
entry in the browser's menu.  It will add an icon in the app launcher
which will run it with a look and feel more similar to a native app
rather than a web page.  To uninstall it, simply delete the icon.
